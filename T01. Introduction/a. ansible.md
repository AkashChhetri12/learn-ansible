# Ansible 

**What is Ansible?**

Ansible is an open-source automation and configuration management tool that allows you to automate tasks like application deployment, software provisioning, and infrastructure management. It was developed by Red Hat and is widely used for orchestrating IT environments.

Ansible is very lightweight, easy to configure, and is not resource hungry because it
doesnâ€™t need an agent to run (agentless) unlike other automation tools, for example,
Puppet which is agent based and is a bit complex to configure.

**Key Concepts in Ansible:**

1. **Ad-Hoc Commands:** Ansible allows you to run ad-hoc commands to perform quick, one-off tasks on remote hosts.

2. **Inventory:** An inventory file contains a list of hosts that Ansible can connect to and manage. This file typically includes information about each host, such as its IP address, SSH credentials, and any host-specific variables.

3. **Playbooks:** Playbooks are written in YAML format and describe a series of tasks to be executed on remote hosts. Playbooks are the heart of Ansible automation and provide a high-level orchestration of your infrastructure.

4. **Tasks:** Tasks are individual actions that Ansible performs on remote hosts. These actions can include installing packages, copying files, and configuring services. Playbooks consist of one or more tasks.

5. **Modules:** Ansible uses modules to execute tasks on remote hosts. Modules are small programs that Ansible runs on the target system, and they handle everything from system administration to application deployment.

6. **Roles:** Roles are a way to organize and package playbooks and related files. They help in structuring your automation code in a more modular and reusable way.



**How Ansible Works:**

Ansible follows a push-based model, where the control machine (the system where Ansible is installed and executed) pushes configurations and tasks to the target hosts. Ansible communicates with target hosts over SSH (by default), and it doesn't require an agent to be installed on the remote machines.

Ansible is a versatile tool that can be used for various automation tasks in both small and large-scale environments. It's widely used in DevOps and IT operations for managing infrastructure and applications efficiently.

>In science fiction, the word Ansible refers to a hypothetical device that
enable uses to communicate instantaneously across great distances; that is,
a faster-than-light communication device. Now you know where Ansible got
its name inspiration.

## Advantages of Ansible:

1. **Agentless:** Ansible doesn't require any agents or additional software to be installed on target hosts.

2. **Simple Syntax:** Ansible playbooks use human-readable YAML syntax, making them easy to write and understand.

3. **Idempotent:** Ansible is idempotent, which means running the same playbook multiple times won't produce unwanted changes if the target system is already in the desired state.

4. **Extensible:** You can write custom modules and plugins to extend Ansible's functionality.

5. **Community and Ecosystem:** Ansible has a large and active community, and you can find a wide range of pre-built roles and playbooks.
