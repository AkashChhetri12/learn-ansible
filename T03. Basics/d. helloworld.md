To perform a basic "ping" and "hello world" operation using Ansible on a set of hosts defined in your inventory, you can create an Ansible playbook for this purpose. Let's start with a simple playbook for this task:

### Inventory File

You need an inventory file that specifies the target hosts you want to work with. Create a file, let's call it `inventory.ini`, and add your target host(s) to it. For example:

```ini
[web_servers]
web1 ansible_host=192.168.1.101
web2 ansible_host=192.168.1.102
```

Replace `ansible_host` with the IP addresses or hostnames of your target machines.

### Ansible Playbook

Now, create a basic Ansible playbook, let's call it `ping_hello.yml`, to execute the "ping" and "hello world" tasks on the hosts from your inventory:

```yaml
---
- name: Ping and Hello World
  hosts: web_servers
  tasks:
    - name: Ping the hosts
      ping:

    - name: Print "Hello, World!"
      debug:
        msg: "Hello, World!"
```

This playbook defines a play named "Ping and Hello World" that runs on the hosts specified in the `[web_servers]` group in the inventory. It includes two tasks: one to ping the hosts using the built-in `ping` module and another to print "Hello, World!" using the `debug` module.

### Running the Playbook

You can execute the playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command as follows:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini ping_hello.yml
```

This command runs the `ping_hello.yml` playbook on the hosts defined in the `inventory.ini` file. The output will show the results of the ping task and the "Hello, World!" message on each of the target hosts.

### Ad-Hoc Commands

If you prefer to run ad-hoc commands for "ping" and "hello world," you can use the `ansible` command. Here are two examples:

1. **Ping the hosts:**

   ```bash
   ansible -i inventory.ini web_servers -m ping
   ```

2. **Print "Hello, World!":**

   ```bash
   ansible -i inventory.ini web_servers -a "echo 'Hello, World!'"
   ```

In the first command, we're using the `-m` option to specify the module (`ping`), and in the second command, we're using the `-a` option to specify the command to run.

Both ad-hoc commands will produce output for each host in the `[web_servers]` group in the inventory.
